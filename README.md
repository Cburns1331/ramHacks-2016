#HackerBuddy-Ram Hacks 2016
The HackerBuddy is the avid hackathonor's best friend. They can be sure they are up to date with the latest news no matter what hackathon they are at because HackerBuddy scraps the mlh.io site live, all 50+ of them from every country! HackerBuddy can then explain to them what events are happening, at what time, and even prompts the user to save events straight to their calander. It can even tell the hacker what quanity of which hardware is still left up for grabs at a moments notice! Most importantly the hacker doesn't have to waste time setting up the HackerBuddy because it is all container in a single docker conatiner. Ready to be deployed at a moments notice! And while their at it why not hack HackerBuddy themselves. With HackerBuddy's continous integration through advanced Jenkin's pipelines and git they know that whenever they push a change to thier fork it will be tested against nothing short of the best Test cases in the world!
